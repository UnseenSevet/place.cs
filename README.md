# place.cs
source files for the place.cs survival server's plugin

good luck figuring out my code because goddamn is it disgusting. there's very few comments and some might be like. not correct at all whoops

to set this up just compile the solution in the `\source files` directory (i used sharpdevelop) and replace nas.dll in a fresh copy of NAS with the one from here. also please make sure to ask goodly and not me abt how to compile because it took me a long time to set that up and i forget how

if you have problems feel free to send them to pepsi#1213 but don't always expect a reply. i won't spend more than like half an hour helping you fix something unless i get hyperfixated on it

the `\properties` directory has some useful stuff too, like the server settings and all that. also i made sure to include the block properties json file so that isn't an issue
